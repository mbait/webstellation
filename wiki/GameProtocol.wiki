#summary Format of client/server interaction protocol
<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Overview =

Clients use series of requests in [http://www.json.org/ JSON] format to communicate with a game server.  Requests are sent between a client and a server using POST method of HTTP protocol, where the text of a query is stored as value of the only variable named `r`.  Each query is an object (an unordered set of name/value pairs) that contains parameters of a game operation.  The correct query has mandatory parameter `action` containing the identifier of an operation for the server to perform.  Presence or absence of other parameters depends on a particular action.

The server's response on a request is also a JSON object with mandatory field `result` (containing string "`ok`", meaning successful query execution, or the identifier of an error occurred from the list [#Error_Messages below]).  Optionally, any response has field `message` containing a text message to the end user.  Again, depending on the type of an action, response object contains additional fields describing the result of an operation.

= Structures =

== Map Related Structures ==

=== `MapInfo` ===

A map is represented by undirected, unweighted graph which is a model of the star system.  Note that for purposes of visual simplicity a _planar_ graph is desirable.

|| `name` || _string_ || Name of the game map. ||
|| `planets` || _array_ || [#PlanetInfo PlanetInfo] structures that represent the planets and its' positions on the map; order is not important. ||

=== `PlanetInfo` ===

|| `x` || _integer_ || X-coordinate of the planet on Cartesian plane. ||
|| `y` || _integer_ || Y-coordinate of the planet on Cartesian plane. ||
|| `size` || _integer_ || Size of the planet; equals to 1, 2, or 3. ||
|| `neighbors` || _array_ || Indices of the adjacent planets (starting from zero) in `planets` array of [#MapInfo MapInfo] structure; order is not important. ||

=== `PlanetState` ===

|| `owner` || _integer_ || Index of the player who owns the planet (starting from zero) in `players` array of `GameInfo` structure. ||
|| `bases` || _integer_ || The number of bases built on the planet; lays in range from zero to the size of this planet. ||

== Player Related Structures ==

=== `PlayerInfo` ===

|| `name` || _string_ || Name of the player. ||
|| `isReady` || _boolean_ || Readiness of the player to start the game (if he has joined one). ||

|| `map` || _string_ || Name of the game map used. ||
|| `maxPlayers` || _integer_ || The maximal allowable number of players in the game. ||
|| `players` || _array_ || [#PlayerInfo PlayerInfo] structures that represent the players; sorted in the order of joining the game (so the player who's created it is always the first one). ||
|| `status` || _string_ || Status of the game; equals to "`preparing`", "`playing`", "`finished`", or "`loaded`".||

=== `GameState` ===

|| `active` || _integer_ || Index of the player who makes the turn (starting from zero) in `players` array of `GameInfo` structure. ||
|| `planets` || _array_ || [#PlanetState PlanetState] structures that represent state of the planets; sorted in exactly the same order as `planets` array in `MapInfo` structure. ||
|| `score` || _array_ || [#PlayerScore PlayerScore] structures that represents score of every player in the game; sorted in exactly the same order as `players` array in `GameInfo` structure. ||


= Queries =

Query is entirely defined by set of its input and output parameters, as well as a list of types of errors that may occur during processing.

All the queries has parameters:
|| *`>`* || `action` || _string_ || Name of the action to execute from the list below; all other parameters are depend on it. ||

|| *`<`* || `result` || _string_ || "`ok`" or [#Error_Messages error identifier]. ||
|| *`<`* || `message` || _string_ || Descriptive text. ||

Regardless of the type of a query errors of these types could occur:
|| *`!`* || `formatError` ||
|| *`!`* || `generalError` ||

If errors of several types occurred at the same time, then the only one of them is reported, that that listed earlier in the list of errors of the processing query.  `formatError` is always first type in list of error types of a query, and `generalError` is always last one.  Other possible types of errors are listed below for each action.
